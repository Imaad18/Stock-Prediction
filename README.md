# Optimized Stock Price Prediction
# Overview
* This project implements a stock price prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The application leverages historical stock data to predict future stock prices and visualize the results. It provides an intuitive and interactive interface built using Streamlit, which allows users to input stock tickers, select date ranges, and view predictions and comparisons between multiple stocks.

# Key Features:

* Predicts future stock prices using LSTM.

* Displays the stock's actual vs predicted prices.

* Compares multiple stocks by visualizing their price movements.

* Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

* Parallel data fetching for faster performance.

* Real-time stock price display.

# Technologies Used

* Python: Programming language used for implementing the model and app.

* TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.

* yFinance: For fetching historical stock data.

* Streamlit: For building the interactive web app.

* Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing stock data and predictions.

* Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation.
